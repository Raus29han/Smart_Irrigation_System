# üåø Smart Irrigation System using Machine Learning

An intelligent, sensor-driven irrigation automation system that uses machine learning to predict sprinkler activation across 20 zones. Designed for efficiency, water conservation, and real-time control, the project integrates a trained ML model with an interactive Streamlit dashboard and historical logging system.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation systems are inefficient‚Äîrelying on fixed schedules rather than actual soil conditions‚Äîleading to water wastage, poor crop health, and high labor costs.

> The challenge: How can we create an adaptive, intelligent irrigation system that responds to real-time soil data?

## üí° Solution

A smart irrigation dashboard that:
- Collects data from 20 virtual soil sensors.
- Uses a trained **MultiOutputClassifier** to predict the ON/OFF status of sprinklers.
- Displays predictions and historical trends in an intuitive UI built with **Streamlit**.
- Logs every decision for transparency and optimization.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Normalized sensor values between 0‚Äì1.
   - Used labeled CSV (`irrigation_machine.csv`) for supervised learning.

2. **Model Training**
   - Trained a multi-output classifier using scikit-learn.
   - Exported the model as `Farm_Irrigation_System.pkl`.

3. **Web App Development**
   - Built a real-time dashboard using Streamlit.
   - Created sliders for input, and charts for visual feedback.

4. **Prediction & Logging**
   - Predictions are generated live, displayed with parcel-wise status.
   - Logs are saved in `prediction_history.csv`.

5. **Historical Analytics**
   - Line charts visualize past sprinkler activations.
   - CSV download option allows external analysis.
